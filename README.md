# psexport-shl

A web-based editor that highlights the
[Pok√©mon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) export format syntax.

Created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Plans

- [ ] Convert this to a HighlightJS plugin package, keeping the web editor as
a showcase.
- [ ] Deploy this using GitHub Pages
- [ ] Get the syntax highlighter to work properly
